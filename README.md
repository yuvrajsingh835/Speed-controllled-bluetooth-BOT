# Speed-controllled-bluetooth-BOT

**Project Description:**

This project details the creation of a Bluetooth-controlled robot using an Arduino Uno. The robot can be commanded to move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right using a mobile application that communicates with the Arduino via a Bluetooth module. A key feature of this project is the speed control functionality, allowing the user to adjust the motor speed in real-time, giving a high degree of control over the robot's movement. The robot also includes a buzzer for audible feedback. This project was developed as a part of a course at IIT, showcasing practical application of microcontrollers, motor control, and wireless communication.
